# FileIOJava

As we start to use our programs to analyze more and more information, having a way to import and export information becomes critical. 
This is where file input and output become important. In this tutorial, we are going to look at a few things. 
First, we are going to take a look at how we read in lines from a file. 
We will then look at some very basic string manipulation to split our lines. Finally, we will look at how we can write out results to a file.

Look at each *step* and figure out how to run the code in IntelliJ.

AND add a `pom.xml` file...

Make sure the Java version is _at least_ 11.

### a _pom.xml_ file

In a Java project, the pom.xml file is used to manage the project's dependencies and build configuration using Apache Maven.

The pom.xml file contains information about the project, such as its name, version, and description, as well as a list of dependencies that the project requires to compile and run. Maven uses this information to download the required dependencies from a central repository and add them to the project's classpath.

The pom.xml file also contains build configuration information, such as the location of the source code and the output directory for compiled code. It can be used to specify plugins that perform various tasks, such as running unit tests, generating documentation, or creating executable JAR files.

By using a pom.xml file, developers can easily manage their project's dependencies and build configuration, and can automate many common tasks using Maven plugins. This can save time and reduce errors, and can make it easier to maintain and update the project over time.

### So a _pom.xml_ file is important?
In addition to managing a project's dependencies and build configuration, a pom.xml file in a Java project can also perform other tasks, such as:

- Packaging the project: The pom.xml file can specify how the project should be packaged, such as creating a JAR or WAR file.
- Running tests: The pom.xml file can specify how to run unit tests and integration tests, and can generate reports on the test results.
- Generating documentation: The pom.xml file can specify how to generate documentation for the project, such as Javadoc or HTML documentation.
- Deploying the project: The pom.xml file can specify how to deploy the project to a remote server or repository, such as Maven Central.
- Configuring plugins: The pom.xml file can configure various plugins that perform tasks such as code analysis, code coverage, or code formatting.

Managing profiles: The pom.xml file can define profiles that specify different configurations for different environments, such as development, testing, or production.

So the pom.xml file is a powerful tool for managing a Java project's dependencies, build configuration, and other tasks. By using Maven and the pom.xml file, developers can automate many common tasks and ensure that their project is built consistently and correctly across different environments.
And yes, it's really important to java projects.

### So is reading/writing data from files important?

Reading and writing data from files is important in programming because it allows programs to store and retrieve data even after the program has terminated. This is useful for a variety of reasons, such as:

- Data persistence: By storing data in a file, programs can ensure that the data is available even after the program has terminated. This is useful for applications that need to store user preferences, application settings, or other data that needs to persist between sessions.
- Data sharing: Files can be used to share data between different programs or different instances of the same program. This is useful for applications that need to exchange data with other applications or that need to communicate between different parts of the same application.
- Data backup: By storing data in a file, programs can create backups of important data in case of system failures or other disasters. This is important for applications that store critical data, such as financial data or medical records.
- Data analysis: Files can be used to store large amounts of data that can be analyzed later. This is useful for applications that need to process large amounts of data, such as scientific simulations or financial analysis.

And dammit, reading and writing data from files is an important part of programming that allows programs to store and retrieve data in a flexible and persistent way.
